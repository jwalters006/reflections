What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository, a hidden folder(.git) is created.  This folder contains meta-deta
	concerning the new repository that is created.  You need to initialize the repository in order to
	begin tracking changes in the files within the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area differs from the working directory and the repository in that it servers as an
	intermediate area in which changes to files are prepared, but not yet executed.  It offers value
	in the form of serving as a buffer zone that can be loaded with potential code changes, without
	requiring a user to finalize and execute these changes.
